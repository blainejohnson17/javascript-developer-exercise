# Javascript Developer Exercise
## Array -- asyncMap

## INSTRUCTIONS

Your task with this exercise is to extend the built in Array object with an
asyncMap function which calls a callback with the results. See `exercise.js` for
an example.

Please note that each call of the transform function should be asynchronous.

Do not spend more than two hours effort on the problem. Thanks!
